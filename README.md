The software has been tested on Windows 10 Pro x64 (build 19635.1) with .NET Framework 4.8 and works perfectly.
However it has not been tester on Linux not macOS yet, so feel free to test it on those platforms and to give me some feedbacks.

The NuGet packages are up to date, but you will have to download them.
To do so, right click on a project (let's say the Resource one), then click on "Manage NuGet packages". Here you will have an "Update" tab, select all packages then click on the "Update" button.
Then repeat for the second project.
